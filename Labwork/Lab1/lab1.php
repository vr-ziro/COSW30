        <h1>Hi There!</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Victor Rodriguez and I seriously enjoy art and tech. Ever since I can remember I have always been interested in how technology worked as well as the performing arts. Ended up learning a few instruments and am now picking up coding. P.S my GitHub profile can be found <a href="https://github.com/vr-ziro">here.</a></p>
        
        <p>My Hobbies include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Coding</li>
            <li>Playing Drums</li>
            <li>Going to Concerts</li>
        </ul>

            echo '<p>Hmmm, along the lines of websites that I use, it would probably have to be between <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse">Netflix</a>, and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>. Mainly because I tend to watch alot of shows to relax and look up alot of problems when coding.<p>';
            echo '<p> As a whole, this assignment was not too bad, honesly pretty cool to think I have 3 different languages within 1 file. All in all, I am looking forward to what PHP has to offer.'
